--- Starting adventure. ---


Being a bright ECE undergraduate on the prestigious UIUC campus, you have
decided to enroll in ECE198KL, subjecting yourself to sleep deprivation 
and the debilitating effects of 'Engineering humor' in search of a deeper
understanding of computers and their design.

You stand in the Bardeen Quad.  You stand in the rain.  Recalling that
standing in the rain can make you sick, you briefly consider trying to 
get sick instead of finishing tonight's MP, but decide to retain that
option for later.

You can (1) head into Everitt, (2) wave to the Engineer and enter Grainger,
or (3) go down to Green Street.

Please enter your choice: 1


You stand in the hallway of Everitt Lab, at peace with yourself, thinking
that there's no place like home.  Finally, your reverie shatters as you 
remember that 'home' isn't necessarily the place where you spend 
five-sixths of your life.

The lab beckons from upstairs.  Will you (1) heed its call and go upstairs,
(2) head down to the vending machine for a pop, or (3) return to the
Bardeen Quad for another day's dose of fresh air?

Please enter your choice: 2


As always, the vending machines are nearly empty.  In fact, the soda
machine IS empty, but you spot a can of Dew on a nearby table, lost
by some poor chump.  There's also one candy bar left; it's not your
favorite, but it's hardly time to get picky with only a couple of
hours left for your MP.

Will you (1) walk away from this golden opportunity, (2) buy the
bar, or (3) drink the Dew and leave the can for its owner?

Please enter your choice: 2


You glance longingly at the Dew, then drop some coins into the vending
machine to get the candy bar.  

Mmmmm...that tastes great.  There's nothing like a balanced, 
nutritional meal from a vending machine.  Beats day-old pizza
any time!

Unfortunately, you're still a bit groggy.  Press (1) to continue.

Please enter your choice: 1


As always, the vending machines are empty.  Fortunately, you spot
a can of Dew on a nearby table, lost by some poor chump.  

Will you (1) walk away from this golden opportunity, or (2) slide the
Dew smoothly into your bag?

Please enter your choice: 2


With unprecedented grace (for an Engineeer, that is), you flick your
wrist near the can, causing it to topple over into your bag.  Peering
about quickly with a faux mask of surprise, you hide the evidence
and move quickly to the stairs.

Press (1) to return to the next floor.

Please enter your choice: 3


You stand in the Bardeen Quad.  You stand in the rain.  You are well fed
and wide awake, but you thirst for knowledge.  Where will you find it?
Surely you need it to complete the MP in time!

You can (1) head into Everitt, (2) wave to the Engineer and enter Grainger,
or (3) go down to Green Street.

Please enter your choice: 3


Why are you poking around Campustown instead of working on your MP?
Don't you have any sense of priority?  Get back to work!  You can
crawl later tonight.  Besides, you can't crawl here without a car, and
you can't have a car if you're crawling...something like that, anyway.

Press (1) to head towards Za's for some refreshment, (2) to return to 
the Bardeen Quad, or (3) to head home and log in.

Please enter your choice: 3


You head home and log in to remsun1.  

Will you (1) work on your MP, (2) read the Web Board, or 
(3) log out and go back to Green Street?

Please enter your choice: 2



You read the posts.  You write some yourself.  The answers are vague,
the knowledge is nebulous, the point is dull.  You contemplate ways
in which you can sharpen your wit and your wisdom.  A good cubicle
is what you need.  The Halls of Grainger spring to mind.

Do you (1) take a shot at the MP, or (2) head out to Green Street?

Nothing braces the Engineer like the aroma of a good cubicle, and Grainger
is chock full of them.  Of course, study carrels aren't quite as aromatic
as something in Standard Grey, but it's the closest thing that you can
find on campus.

You spot a free study carrel.  Will you (1) sit down to read the book, or
(2) head south to imitate the Engineer, or (3) continue to the North in the
hope of finding Lumetta himself?

Please enter your choice: 1


You settle yourself into the carrel and begin to read.  Caffeine and a full
stomach combine with your natural brainpower, enabling you to finally grok
the goals of MP2.  Basking in your epiphany, you easily plan your course
of action.

Press (1) to embark on the next day of the rest of your life, or at least
the rest of the time before you turn in the MP.  Sadly, you will have to
leave this little virtual world after you finish your MP, but that's another
story.

You stand in the Bardeen Quad, ready for anything, including your MP.

or (3) go down to Green Street.

You stand in the hallway of Everitt Lab, eager to begin your MP.

The lab beckons from upstairs.  Will you (1) heed its call and go upstairs,
(2) head down to the vending machine for a pop, or (3) return to the
Bardeen Quad for another day's dose of fresh air?

Please enter your choice: 1


The second-floor hallway of Everitt teems with life, but what is life
compared with the creation of an MP?  You know that you are ready.

The TAs office is upstairs, but the TAs seem to have gone home for the
evening.  The lab is also open.

Will you (1) look for a TA, (2) enter the lab, or (3) head downstairs?

Please enter your choice: 1


Have some confidence!  Get to work!  The TAs are gone for the night 
anyway.

Press (1) to return to the second floor.

Tension in the lab has risen to a fevered pitch.  Suddenly, a resounding
slap announces the start of another duel over machines.  Pistols at 
thirty paces.  They won't need that machine for a while!  You quickly
step up to the keyboard.

Press (1) to start your MP.

Please enter your choice: 1


You quickly whip together a beautiful flow chart for your design,
then write a stunningly eloquent paragraph intimating your inventive
and masterful approach for the benefit of the staff as well as your
inevitably perfect grade.

Press (1) to press through to the finish, or (2) to break off for
a snack.

-------------------------- CONGRATULATIONS! --------------------------

You have beaten the system and completed MP2 with a perfect score!

Now if only this could be the real world...good luck!
