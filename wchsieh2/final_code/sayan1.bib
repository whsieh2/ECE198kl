	A if every behavior of A ultimately reaches S within bounded time.
	Inevitability captures various common liveness properties. In this

	Hybrid Automata (LHA). The algorithm combines (a) Lyapunov function-based
	relational abstractions for the continuous dynamics with (b) automated
	construction of well-founded relations for the loops of the hybrid
	automaton. The algorithm is complete for automata that are symmetric
	with respect to the chosen Lyapunov functions. The algorithm is implemented
	in a prototype tool (LySHA ) which is integrated with a Simulink/Stateflow
	frontend for modeling hybrid systems. The experimental results demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the methodology in verifying inevitability of
	hybrid automata with up to five continuous dimensions and forty locations.},

	is equipped with a finite collection of pointers to other automata

  abstract = {The paper presents a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement
	procedure for verifying stability (region stabillity) of CPS modeled
	as hybrid automata. It relies on a characterization of the blocking
	property of hybrid automata in terms of well-foundedness of a relation
	that combines the discrete transitions and continuous trajectories
	and a key assumption about the switching speed of the system in terms
	of average dwell time, but does not require the individual modes
	to be stable. This characterization enables the adaptation of program
	analysis techniques to the domain of hybrid systems. It is shown
	that the procedure is complete for rectangular initialized hybrid

	(a) converge to and maintain an equi-spaced lattice formation, (b)
	arrive at a destination, and (c) always maintain a minimum safe separation.
	Safe flocking in Euclidean spaces is a well-studied and difficult
	coordination problem. In this paper, we study one-dimensional safe
	flocking in the presence of actuator faults and directional failure
	detectors (DFDs). Actuator faults cause affected agents to move permanently
	with arbitrary velocities, and DFDs detect failures only when actuation
	and required motion are in opposing directions. First, assuming existence
	of a DFD for actuator faults, we present an algorithm for safe flocking.
	Next, we show that certain actuator faults cannot be detected with
	DFDs, while detecting others requires time that grows linearly with
	the number of participating agents. Finally, we show that our DFD
	algorithm achieves the latter bound.},

	robots. Our strategy is for the mobile robots to implement a self-stabilizing
	virtual layer consisting of mobile client nodes, stationary Virtual
	Nodes (VNs), and local broadcast communication. The VNs are associated
	with predetermined regions in the plane and coordinate among themselves
	to distribute the client nodes relatively uniformly among the VNs�
	regions. Each VN directs its local client nodes to align themselves
	on the local portion of the target curve. The resulting motion coordination
	protocol is self-stabilizing, in that each robot can begin the execution
	in any arbitrary state and at any arbitrary location in the plane.
	In addition, self-stabilization ensures that the robots can adapt
	to changes in the desired target formation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a dynamic graph theoretic framework for flocking in presence of multiple obstacles. In particular, we give formal definitions of nets and flocks as spatially induced graphs and define flocking. We introduce the notion of framenets and describe a procedure for automatic construction of an energy function for groups of agents. The task of flocking is achieved via dissipation of this energy according to a protocol that only requires the use of local information. We show that all three rules of Reynolds are hidden in this single protocol. Three types of agents called $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ agents are used to create flocking. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate flocking by 100 dynamic agents.},
