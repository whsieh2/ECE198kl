In July 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that the main objective of the Allied forces in the 
South Pacific and Southwest Pacific area commands was to capture the major 
Japanese base at Rabaul on the eastern tip of New Britain. 
From August 1942, U.S. and Australian forces conducted a series of offensives 
in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with the goals of eliminating Japanese 
positions in the region and establishing air bases close to Rabaul. 
The Japanese forces in the area mounted a strong resistance, but were unable to stop 
the Allied advance.[3]

In June 1943, the Allies launched a major offensive—designated 
Operation Cartwheel—to capture Rabaul. During the next five months, 
Australian and U.S. forces under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur 
advanced along the north coast of eastern New Guinea, capturing the town of Lae and 
the Huon Peninsula. U.S. forces under the command of Admiral William Halsey, Jr. 
simultaneously advanced through the Solomon Islands from Guadalcanal, and established an 
air base at Bougainville in November.[4] In June, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided 
that it was unnecessary to capture Rabaul as the Japanese base there could be 
neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment. MacArthur initially opposed this 
change in plans, it was endorsed by the British and United States Combined Chiefs of
 Staff during the Quebec Conference in August.[5]

The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assessed the strategic situation in the 
Southwest Pacific in late September 1943, and concluded that the Allies would attempt 
to break through the northern Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago in the coming 
months en route to Japan's inner perimeter in the western and central Pacific. 
Accordingly, reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in the area in an 
attempt to slow the Allied advance. Strong forces were retained at Rabaul, however, 
as it was believed that the Allies would attempt to capture the town. At the time, Japanese positions in western New Britain were limited to airfields at Cape Gloucester on the island's western tip and several small way stations which provided small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea with shelter from Allied aerial attacks.[6]
On 22 September 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) directed Lieutenant 
General Walter Krueger's Alamo Force to secure western New Britain and the 
surrounding islands. This operation had two goals, the first of which was to establish 
air and PT boat bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective 
was to secure the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits between New Guinea and New Britain so 
that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along 
New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that both Cape 
Gloucester and Gasmata on New Britain's south coast be captured. This offensive was 
code-named Operation Dexterity.[7] The 1st Marine Division was selected for the Cape 
Gloucester operation, and the heavily reinforced 126th Regimental Combat Team from the 
32nd Infantry Division was to attack Gasmata.[8]

Senior Allied commanders disagreed over whether it was necessary to land forces 
in western New Britain. Lieutenant General George Kenney—commander of the Allied Air 
Forces in the Southwest Pacific—opposed the landings, arguing that his forces did not 
need air fields at Cape Gloucester as the existing bases in New Guinea and surrounding 
islands were adequate to support the planned landings in the region. Vice Admiral 
Arthur S. Carpender—commander of both the 7th Fleet and the Allied Naval Forces, 
Southwest Pacific Area—as well as Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey—commander of Task 
Force 76 (TF 76)—supported occupying Cape Gloucester to secure both sides of the straits, 
but opposed the landing at Gasmata as it was too close to the Japanese air bases at 
Rabaul. The Gasmata operation was cancelled in early November in response to the 
concerns raised by Kenney and the Navy as well as intelligence reports that the 
Japanese had reinforced their garrison there.[9]

On 21 November, a conference between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey was held in 
Brisbane at which it was decided to land a small force in the Arawe area.[10] This 
operation had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to 
provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact 
with the Marines once they landed.[11] It was intended that PT boats operating from 
Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain 
and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.

The Arawe area lies on the south coast of New Britain about 100 mi (160 km) from 
the island's western tip. Its main geographical feature is Cape Merkus, which ends in 
the "L"-shaped Arawe Peninsula. Several small islands called the Arawe Islands lie to the 
southwest of the Cape.[13]

In late 1943, the Arawe Peninsula was covered by coconut trees which formed part of 
the Amalut Plantation; the terrain inland from the peninsula and on its offshore islands 
was swampy. Most of the shoreline in the area has limestone cliffs.[13][14] There was 
a small unused airfield 4 mi (6.4 km) east of the neck of the Arawe Peninsula, and a 
coastal trail leading east from Cape Merkus to the Pulie River where it split into 
tracks running inland and along the coast. The terrain to the west of the peninsula was 
a trackless region of swamp and jungle, which was very difficult for troops to move 
through.[14] Several of the beaches in the Arawe area were suitable for landing craft; 
the best were House Fireman on the peninsula's west coast and the village of Umtingalu 
to the east of the peninsula's base.[15]
