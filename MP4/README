UIUC ECE198KL Spring 2013 Program 4 version 1.0.0

-----------------------------
   DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS
-----------------------------

This program is an assignment based on WALY that I wrote for UIUC
ECE198KL in February 2013.  This version runs on several platforms.

The program and all components are (C) Copyright 2011-2013 by 
Steven S. Lumetta.

The program is free software covered by the GNU General Public
License, and you are welcome to modify it and/or distribute copies of
it it under certain conditions.  The file COPYING (included with the
distribution) specifies those conditions.  There is absolutely no
warranty for MazeRun, as described in the file NO_WARRANTY (also
included in the distribution).  You must also include a verbatim copy
of this file as part of a file called README in any distribution.


---------------------
   NECESSARY TOOLS
---------------------

Installation of the packaged Windows version should not require any
tools.

Installation from source requires versions of gcc (the Gnu C compiler)
and make, which are available for free from many sources.  You will
also need SDL and any related software.  I installed these from sources.
For Windows, I recommend installing Cygwin.

See the README-WALY for more detail on other platforms.


-------------------------------
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

To install the Windows version, launch the installer and follow the
directions.  To install from source, type "make" in the source
directory.

By default, the Windows installer places all components as a
subdirectory of the Program Files folder.  You can override this
location as necessary.  

Please send any comments or bug reports to me at lumetta@illinois.edu.
Unfortunately, due to the volume of e-mail that I receive on a regular
basis, I cannot guarantee that I will respond to your mail, but I will
almost definitely read it.
